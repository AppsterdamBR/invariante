"This unique and interactive program combines an exclusive iPad application and a dynamic web portal to fully map your patients flow through your practice from check-in to check-out. The diagnostic will illustrate where constraints exist that are creating interruptions in patient flow. From here you can begin to understand specifically where improvements need to be made, guided by a series of questions aimed at identifying the root cause(s)."
